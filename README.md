MeshCore SAR helps teams coordinate in low-connectivity or no-connectivity environments with messaging, voice, images, maps, and live location context in one app.
It uses the MeshCore protocol over LoRa for long-range, infrastructure-free communication.
`iOS TestFlight:` https://testflight.apple.com/join/tngpPF12

## Highlights

- Rapid mesh chat for both 1:1 and group coordination
- On-demand voice (Codec2) and image (AVIF) transfer tuned for low-bandwidth links
- Offline-first mapping with tactical overlays and SAR incident markers
- Live team location, movement trails, and shareable tactical drawings

## Feature Overview

| Area | What you get |
|---|---|
| Messaging | Direct and group chat over mesh, with contact/room awareness from live telemetry |
| Voice | Push-to-talk voice clips (Codec2), fetched on demand when play is pressed, auto-play on completion |
| Images | Camera/gallery image sending (AVIF), auto-compression, tap-to-load receiving, full-screen viewer |
| Maps | Street/topo/satellite/terrain layers, offline tile downloads, optional MBTiles import |
| SAR Operations | Team markers with freshness indicators, SAR markers for incidents and staging points |
| Tracking | Continuous GPS updates, personal trails, distance/duration trail stats |
| Trail Interop | GPX export/import for trail sharing and reuse |
| Tactical Drawing | Line/rectangle drawing, distance measurement, drawing sharing to channel/room |

## Voice, Image, and Maps

### Voice
- Built for short, urgent field communication
- On-demand playback fetch reduces unnecessary mesh traffic
- Ideal when typing is impractical during active operations

### Images
- Pre-send optimization for constrained links
- Tap-to-load receiving keeps channels lightweight
- Full-screen view supports rapid field verification

### Maps
- Works in both online and offline workflows
- SAR context with team markers, incident markers, and orientation tools
- Combines location, messaging, and tactical layers in one place

## Built For

- Search and Rescue field teams
- Incident command and coordination roles
- Operators working in weak/no cellular coverage

## Connecting Your Radio (BLE)

The app pairs with your MeshCore radio over Bluetooth Low Energy.

### Windows

On Windows 11 (tested on 25H2), pair the radio through the system Bluetooth menu **before** connecting in the app:

1. Open **Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Add device → Bluetooth**.
2. Select your MeshCore radio and complete pairing, entering the **PIN** when prompted.
3. Launch MeshCore SAR and connect — the radio now appears as a paired device.

If the radio does not show up or fails to connect in-app, remove it from the Windows Bluetooth menu and repeat the pairing step.

### iOS / Android

Connect directly from within the app — no separate system pairing step is required.

## Permissions (App Use)

- Bluetooth: mesh device communication
- Location: team tracking and map position updates
- Microphone: voice clip recording
- Camera / Photos: image messaging
